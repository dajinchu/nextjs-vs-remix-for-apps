WIP: What is this repo



Examples: Social media, budgeting app

Characteristics of highly interactive apps.
- Almost every page is personalized
- SEO pages exist but need to render differently for logged-in users
- Pages have multiple interactive elements (dashboards, feeds, netflix-style carousels)
- Interactive components are reused (Facebook's comment box is everywhere)
